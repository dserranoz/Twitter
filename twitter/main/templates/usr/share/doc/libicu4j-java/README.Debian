icu4j for Debian
----------------

Taverna has a runtime dependency on this library. This was the initial
motivation to provide a package, which once you are aware of it seems
of considerable value for the distribution, though.

Please check out http://pkg-escience.alioth.debian.org, follow the link
to the Wiki page and see if you want to maintain or add any package to
your liking.

Best,

Steffen
